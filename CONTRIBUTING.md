# Contributing

First of all, thanks for wanting to contribute to React Native Modal. We hope this document will help
you through your journey into your first Pull Request.
Note that this document is still in construction and some help / suggestions are most welcome.

## Setting the environment

- Fork the repository, create a branch and clone it
- Install dependencies using `yarn install`
- Head into the `example` folder and do the same.
- Head into `ios` and run `pod install` if you wish to compile under iOS
- Get back into the root folder and launch `yarn run dev`. This will launch `ts` in watch mode.
- Get into the `example` folder again and type `yarn run start`.
- You can now open Android Studio or XCode directly from `example/android` or `example/ios` respectively, build
  and run the app.
- When you are done, submit a Pull Request into `master`.
